### Game Play
---
Launch the index.html file, click start, and answer the questions.  The game checks to see if your answer is correct and keeps score for you.  You will be shown totals of correct, incorrect, and not answered questions at the end. 

### Game Notes
---
- This game was developed to practice the implementation of timers and intervals.
- This application currently relies on a fixed set of questions.    
- The game tracks correct, incorrect, and no response conditions
- The game correctly interprets the following:
  -  If you answer correctly and click submit
  -  If you answer correctly and let time expire
  -  If you answer incorrectly and click submit
  -  If you answer incorrectly and let time expire
  -  If you provide no answer and let time expire

### Developer Notes
---
I took the code from a Basic version and modified it for this version of the game.  The retrofit was a good exercise as it allowed me to focus on modifying the elements of the game play and flow.
