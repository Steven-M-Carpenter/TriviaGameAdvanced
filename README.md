GAMEPLAY:
     Launch the index.html file, click start, and answer the questions.  The game checks 
     to see if your answer is correct and keeps score for you.  You will be shown totals
     at the end. 

DEV NOTES:
  -  2 console.log statements in the startCountDown function can be enabled to see the timer work
  -  1 console.log statement is in the splashCorrectAns function can be enabled to see the second timer work
  -  The questions are fixed in this demo.  They never change in content, order, or answer options   
  -  The game tracks correct, incorrect, and no response conditions
  -  The game correctly interprets the following:
        -  If you answer correctly and click submit
        -  If you answer correctly and let time expire
        -  If you answer incorrectly and click submit
        -  If you answer incorrectly and let time expire
        -  If you provide no answer and let time expire
  -  I used the "string literals" to dynamically create the majority of the HTML

HOMEWORK NOTES:
     I took the code from the Basic version and modified it for this version of the game.  The retrofit was a
     good exercise as it allowed me to focus on modifying the elements of the game play and flow that mattered 
     versus spending time on the tedious elements I had already accomplished once, like generating questions, 
     checking answers, and tracking results.
